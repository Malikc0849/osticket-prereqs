Now it's time to create problems! (Not in real life, calm down.) Copy and paste this url into another tab (localhost/osTicket/) and click "open a new ticket." Log into one of the clients you've created, then create your ticket. then do the same again for the other client (if you've created more than one). Once you're done, Log in as one of the agents you've created and look for the tickets that were created.

If you click on any ticket, you can edit how it get's done to update the customer live. You can select the SLA Plan depending on the importance of the problem, and talk to the client down below. You can also transfer the ticket to other departments or to the manager! You can mess around with these features on different tabs for other accounts if you like.

<p>
If you're finished with a ticket on all ends, just click on the ticket status to close out the ticket (Depending on whom you sent the ticket to, if you've transferred a ticket to someone, only that person or people in that department can touch it from there.) Make sure if you're doing this in Azure to delete all of your recources so your bill doesn't skyrocket accidentally!
